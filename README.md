# gd32-tools-xpack-openocd
This repository is created for xPack OpenOCD GD Version to be added as submodule to gd32-cmake repositories.

**OpenOCD** version is **_xpack-openocd-0.11.0-3_**.
	- Extracted from **Embedded Builder** **_V1.4.1.23782_**.
	- I highly suggest <ins>not to use</ins> another version of OpenOCD because of lack of GD32 MCU implementation.
